# Kubernetes ecosystem

## Kubernetes ecosystem overview

1. K is not an all-inclusive platform
2. ecoysystem provides many services that K doesnt have

[https://github.com/cncf/trailmap](https://github.com/cncf/trailmap) - this is a Cloud native computing foundation

landscape [https://landscape.cncf.io](https://landscape.cncf.io)

## Red Hat OpenShift

1. hybrid cloud, entrerpirse Kubernetes application platform, tooling around the complete lifecycle of applications
    1. orchestrate containers
    2. build
    3. CI/CD
    4. monitoring
    5. logging
2. red hat linux $\rightarrow$ kubernets $\rightarrow$ cluster services $\rightarrow$ platform services, application services, developer services

3. OKD - Upstream Kubernetes distribution embedded in OpenShift (analogy - kubernetes is a kernel, openshift is a distribution)

## Red Had OpenShift and Kubernetes

1. Similar Openshift buitlt with kubernetes, open source
2. differences - OpenShift - commercial product, some more user conveniences + more in cli

## Builds

cloud native -> calls for automation.

Asks for CI/CD

Build - process of transforming input (like code) into resultant objects (like container)

BuildConfig defines the process of the build to follow

Build can automate a docker.

### approaches

#### Docker

* repo + Dockerfile + artefacts
* invokes Docker build
* pushes image to internal registry

#### Source-to-image (S2I)

building reproducible container images.

Aggregate builder image + code

#### Custom build

advanced.

* define a builder image

* custom builder images are Docker images that contain the logic needed to transform input into expected output

### build triggers

* webhook
  * send a request to OS container platform API

* image change
  * new version of an image available
  * useful for keeping base imgaes up to date

* configuration change
  * build when a new BuildConfig is created

### ImageStream

abstraction for referencing image within OpenShift. Do not contain image data, but merely pointers. Digests are immutable for each image, image streams can change. The source images that ImageStreams point to can be stored in the internal registry, external registries, or other ImageStreams.

## Operators

1. powerful tool

2. CRDs custom resourse definitions (new endpoint in K API)

3. Can be installed in clusters

4. Once installed, can be accessed with kubectl

5. Dont change state $\rightarrow$ need custom controllers

6. Custom controller + custorm resouses = Operator pattern

7. A proxy for manual tasks of a human operator.

Example:

1. Deploy an application

2. Create a and restore backup states.

OperatorHub - in OpenShift Container Platfors.

Types:

1. Red Hat
2. Certified
3. Community
4. Custom

## Istio

Service mesh. Helps (connect, sercure, control and observe)

Challenges with microservices:

1. Security
2. Canary deployments
3. A/B testing
4. Cascading failures possible

    1. Retries
    2. Circuit breaking

Traffic managed, security, observability.

## Practice quiz

1. Which of the following are Red Hat OpenShift build strategies? Select the three that apply. - custom, docker, source-to-image, not github webhook

2. Which of the following are needed to create an operator? Select the two that apply. - custom resources + controller

3. Istioâ€™s observability features allow you to route users to different versions of a service in order to perform A/B testing or canary deployments. - false

4. Which of the following are true of image streams? Select the two that apply. - help with image management, do not contain image data but pointers

5. The Cloud Native Computing Foundation hosts Kubernetes and all the tools in the Kubernetes ecosystem. - true

## quiz
